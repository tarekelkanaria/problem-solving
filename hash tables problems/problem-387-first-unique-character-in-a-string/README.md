# First Unique Character in a String

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Given a string `s`, _find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index_. If it does not exist, return `-1`. </font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `s`.

- **Space complexity :** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `s`.
