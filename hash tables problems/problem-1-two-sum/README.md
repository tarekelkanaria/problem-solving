# Two Sum

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _**indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in **any order**.</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of nums.

- **Space complexity :** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of nums.
