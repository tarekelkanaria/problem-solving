# Intersection of Two Arrays II

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the biggest array.

- **Space complexity :** `O(m)` where `m` is the length of smallest array.
