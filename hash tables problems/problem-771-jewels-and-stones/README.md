# Jewels and Stones

---

<font color="#1a237e">

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)` Where `n` is the length of `stones`.

- **Space complexity :** `O(m)` where `m` is the length of `jewels`.
